  set 'png' compression format for depth images
* set 'png' compression format for depth images
  By default the compressed_image_transport is using the jpeg format. This is
  a lossy compression format which introduces compression artefacts which are
  not visible in colour images, but corrupt the 16bit depth images.
  Change the depth compression to the lossless png format to keep the original
  data when decompressing depth images.
